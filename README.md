# PassWord Wallet

A little password manager, accessible from everywhere.

1. Enter your main password.
2. Enter the name of the website you want a password for.

It automatically generate a strong password from your main password and the name of the website.

They serve only as seeds so it's brute-force proof and allow you to have very strong and different passwords for websites.
